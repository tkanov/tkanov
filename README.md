### Hi, I'm Igor 👋

I write code, lead teams, and make complex systems work in production.

Most of my time goes to coding and aligning engineering, product, and leadership − turning ambitious ideas into technology that scales and stays secure. I'm hands-on with GenAI, focusing on practical applications that improve throughput and reduce risk.


## What I do

**Architecture**: Maintainable systems that still make sense a year from now.

**Delivery**: Predictable shipping with minimal ceremony.

**Operations and security**: Scaling without breaking things. Security that doesn't get in the way. Infrastructure that supports growth instead of fighting it.

**GenAI**: LLM observability, tracing, evaluation, and cost management − built for production realities.

## Tech stack

- **Languages:** Python, Ruby, Go, TypeScript/JavaScript  
- **Cloud and infra:** AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform  
- **GenAI:** LLM integration, RAG, AI-assisted workflows

## Currently

Building tools for LLM observability and cost tracking. Exploring how GenAI can improve development workflows without sacrificing code quality or security.

- **[EgressLens](https://github.com/tkanov/egresslens)** − monitor outbound network activity from Python apps running in Docker.
- **[LLM Observability PoC](https://github.com/tkanov/llm-observability-poc)** − a Langfuse-based PoC for LLM observability in Python.
- **[ESP32 Kobo Page Turner](https://github.com/tkanov/esp32-bluetooth-remote-kobo)** − ESP32-S3 BLE HID page-turner for Kobo e-readers.

#### ⚡ Side quests

When not writing software, I'm building things on a breadboard. ESP32 firmware, sensors, basic circuits − the kind of stuff that reminds you why hardware is hard 👷
